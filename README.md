# Airline Flight Delays
Above are 3 different notebooks containing some of the analysis performed with the attempt to better understand our data and building models that predict flight delays. 
- The `eda.ipynb` notebook contains all the exploratory data analysis that we performed to better understand our data. It contains a deeper analysis of the features used for the models which include: delays by flight date, by airline, by destination, origin, and much more.
- The `knn_logr.ipynb` notebook contains both the Nearest-Neighbors model and the Logistic Regression model.
- Finally , the `xgbr_dt.ipynb` notebook contains the XGBoost model and the Decision Tree model that we also built to predict flight delay times. In this notebook you will find that the XGBoost had the best performance.
